Hence, it would be better to learn about HTML and CSS before learning Javascript.
However, for me I first took a online course on Javascript on CodeAcademy and I then switched to learning HTML and CSS. 
I think you cannot learn Javascript as once. Javascript has become a massive tool for web developers. I would suggest that you learn at first, the basics of Javascript like syntax and looping. Then , go deeper into Javascript objects, arrays and functions. After that, dive into Object Oriented Javascript as Javascript is an object oriented Program. 
And, try to learn about Jquery , AJAX and like that.
You can then become a front end developer.''')
